# ðŸš— License Plate Recognition System

This project implements a complete **License Plate Recognition (LPR)** system, including:

- **License Plate Detection** â€“ Locating license plates in vehicle images.
- **License Plate Recognition** â€“ Reading the alphanumeric characters from detected license plates.

This system was built using TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and standard Python libraries. The goal is to provide an end-to-end pipeline for training, evaluating, and running inference on custom vehicle image data.
